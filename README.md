# CTF-Journal
## Author: Timothy Loftus (baffoon)

## Introduction

This is my CTF journal, where one can find Python scripts written to either:

1. Automate the process of finishing a challenge. This is to show how the challenges are done. I will leave details within string output of the journal that describe the process. (Warning: Scripts may be dirty.)

2. Hold POC code for exploits used in CTFs.

### Entries

Entries can either be automated exploits or a shell pop so one can perform the exploit. Within these entries will hold my notes for when I finished these challenges. One thing to keep in mind though. Just because there is an entry, doesn't always mean that there will be an automated process.

Meaning, there are some CTFs that you can't automate. This is due to it either being a simulated environment. (There is allways room to see if this option can be created)

Note: If for, for any reason, things don't work for you consider installing the Python libraries and modules that are recommended. If even then they don't work. Please get in contact with me.

### Misc

These are misc titbits that I created for the fun of it. This can range from random notes to things that I find useful. In general, I wan't to make this a mystery box.
